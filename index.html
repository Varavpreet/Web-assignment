    <h3 id="name">Hii!! My Name is Varav</h3>
    <p> "Hey there! I'm Varav, a nature lover and tech enthusiast from Calgary. I enjoy exploring the great
        outdoors and capturing the beauty of Alberta with my camera. When I'm not out on an adventure, I'm experimenting
        with new recipes or diving into the latest tech gadgets. Always up for a good chat or a friendly debate about
        the coolest new tech trends!" I'm a huge fan of music, especially indie rock and hip-hop. I'm also a bit of a
        foodie and enjoy trying out different cuisines. In my
        free time, you can usually find me reading a good book or binge-watching my favorite shows on Netflix. I'm
        always up for an adventure and love exploring new places, whether it's a local hiking trail or a hidden gem in
        the city. So, that's a little glimpse into who I am.Thank you for coming ! Have a wonderful day!!!</p>
